gulp-starter-opinionated
============
This is my take on `git clone https://github.com/greypants/gulp-starter.git`. Set up with Basscss, fontawsome, underscore, divshot, and travis-ci.

I've replaced browser-sync with live reload. I use the SCSS syntax rather than the SASS syntax.

# Basic Usage
Make sure Node 12.x is installed. I recommend using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to manage versions.

#### Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```

#### Start compiling, serving, and watching files
```
npm run development
